This solution is uses output buffer caching to provide the fastest possible caching solution possible for a WordPress website. 

It caches only non-logged-in access of the pages and after a page is first generated, it loads NONE of WordPess.  This means it has a lower execution cost than any WordPress plugin can achieve.

This solution was inspired and originaly coded by Henry Rivera.
